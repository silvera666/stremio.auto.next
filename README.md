📢 IMPORTANT NOTE
I have absolutely no idea about coding or anything related to it. I had ChatGPT write this entire thing for me, and it worked flawlessly. I’m sharing it here in case someone else needs it. If you have any questions, there’s a 99% chance I won’t know the answer, but I’ll do my best to help. 😃

Oh, and just so you know—I’m so lazy and incompetent that I even made AI write this entire description for me, including every single translated sentence. 😆
